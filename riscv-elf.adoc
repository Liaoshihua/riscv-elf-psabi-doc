== Code models

The RISC-V architecture constrains the addressing of positions in the
address space.  There is no single instruction that can refer to an arbitrary
memory position using a literal as its argument.  Rather, instructions exist
that, when combined together, can then be used to refer to a memory position
via its literal.  And, when not, other data structures are used to help the
code to address the memory space.  The coding conventions governing their use
are known as code models.

=== Small

The small code model, or `medlow`, allows the code to address the whole RV32
address space or the lower 2 GiB of the RV64 address space.
By using the instructions `lui` and `ld` or `st`, when referring to an object, or
`addi`, when calculating an address literal, for example,
a 32-bit address literal can be produced.
This code model is not position independent.

=== Medium

The medium code model, or `medany`, allows the code to address the range
between -2 GiB and +2 GiB from its position.  By using the instructions `auipc`
and `ld` or `st`, when referring to an object, or
`addi`, when calculating an address literal, for example,
a signed 32-bit offset, relative to the value of the `pc` register,
can be produced.
This code model is position independent.

As a special edge-case, undefined weak symbols must still be supported, whose
addresses will be 0 and may be out of range depending on the address at which
the code is linked. Any references to possibly-undefined weak symbols should be
made indirectly through the GOT as is used for position-independent code. Not
doing so is deprecated and a future version of this specification will require
using the GOT, not just advise.

NOTE: This is not yet a requirement as existing toolchains predating this part
of the specification do not adhere to this, and without improvements to linker
relaxation support doing so would regress performance and code size.

== C++ Name Mangling

{Cpp} name mangling for RISC-V follows the
http://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/[Itanium {Cpp} ABI]; there are no RISC-V
specific mangling rules.

See
http://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#mangling-type[Type encodings]
for more detail on how to mangle types.

== ELF Object Files

=== File Header

e_ident::
  EI_CLASS::: Specifies the base ISA, either RV32 or RV64.  We don't let users
  link RV32 and RV64 code together.
+
--
[horizontal]
ELFCLASS64:::: ELF-64 Object File
ELFCLASS32:::: ELF-32 Object File
--

e_type:: Nothing RISC-V specific.

e_machine:: Identifies the machine this ELF file targets.  Always contains
EM_RISCV (243) for RISC-V ELF files.  We only support RISC-V v2 family ISAs,
this support is implicit.

e_flags:: Describes the format of this ELF file.  These flags are used by the
linker to disallow linking ELF files with incompatible ABIs together.

| RVC   | Float ABI  | RVE   | TSO   | *Reserved*  | *Non-standard extensions*
|===

  EF_RISCV_RVC (0x0001)::: This bit is set when the binary targets the C ABI,
  which allows instructions to be aligned to 16-bit boundaries (the base RV32
  and RV64 ISAs only allow 32-bit instruction alignment).  When linking
  objects which specify EF_RISCV_RVC, the linker is permitted to use RVC
  instructions such as C.JAL in the relaxation process.

  EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SOFT (0x0000):::
  EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SINGLE (0x0002):::
  EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_DOUBLE (0x0004):::
  EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_QUAD (0x0006)::: These flags identify the floating point
  ABI in use for this ELF file.  They store the largest floating-point type
  that ends up in registers as part of the ABI (but do not control if code
  generation is allowed to use floating-point internally).  The rule is that
  if you have a floating-point type in a register, then you also have all
  smaller floating-point types in registers.  For example _DOUBLE would
  store "float" and "double" values in F registers, but would not store "long
  double" values in F registers.  If none of the float ABI flags are set, the
  object is taken to use the soft-float ABI.

  EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI (0x0006)::: This macro is used as a mask to test for one
  of the above floating-point ABIs, e.g.,
  `(e_flags & EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI) == EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_DOUBLE`.

  EF_RISCV_RVE (0x0008)::: This bit is set when the binary targets the E ABI.

  EF_RISCV_TSO (0x0010)::: This bit is set when the binary requires the RVTSO
  memory consistency model.
+
Until such a time that the *Reserved* bits (0x00ffffe0) are allocated by future
versions of this specification, they shall not be set by standard software.
Non-standard extensions are free to use bits 24-31 for any purpose. This many
conflict with other non-standard extensions.
+
NOTE: There is no provision for compatibility between conflicting uses of the
e_flags bits reserved for non-standard extensions, and many standard RISC-V
tools will ignore them. Do not use them unless you control both the toolchain
and the operating system, and the ABI differences are so significant they
cannot be done with a .RISCV.attributes tag nor an ELF note, such as using a
different syscall ABI.

=== Sections

There are no RISC-V specific definitions relating to ELF sections.

=== String Tables

There are no RISC-V specific definitions relating to ELF string tables.

=== Symbol Table

There are no RISC-V specific definitions relating to ELF symbol tables.

=== Relocations

RISC-V is a classical RISC architecture that has densely packed non-word
sized instruction immediate values. While the linker can make relocations on
arbitrary memory locations, many of the RISC-V relocations are designed for
use with specific instructions or instruction sequences. RISC-V has several
instruction specific encodings for PC-Relative address loading, jumps,
branches and the RVC compressed instruction set.

The purpose of this section is to describe the RISC-V specific instruction
sequences with their associated relocations in addition to the general purpose
machine word sized relocations that are used for symbol addresses in the
Global Offset Table or DWARF meta data.

The following table provides details of the RISC-V ELF relocations (instruction
specific relocations show the instruction type in the Details column):

|===

Nonstandard extensions are free to use relocation numbers 192-255 for any
purpose.  These relocations may conflict with other nonstandard extensions.

This section and later ones contain fragments written in assembler. The precise
assembler syntax, including that of the relocations, is described in the
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-asm-manual[RISC-V Assembly Programmer's Manual].

==== Absolute Addresses

32-bit absolute addresses in position dependent code are loaded with a pair
of instructions which have an associated pair of relocations:
`R_RISCV_HI20` plus `R_RISCV_LO12_I` or `R_RISCV_LO12_S`.

The `R_RISCV_HI20` refers to an `LUI` instruction containing the high
20-bits to be relocated to an absolute symbol address. The `LUI` instruction
is followed by an I-Type instruction (add immediate or load) with an
`R_RISCV_LO12_I` relocation or an S-Type instruction (store) and an
`R_RISCV_LO12_S` relocation. The addresses for pair of relocations are
calculated like this:

[horizontal]
HI20:: `((symbol_address + 0x800) >> 12)`
LO12:: `symbol_address - (hi20 << 12)`

The following assembly and relocations show loading an absolute address:

[,asm]
----
    lui  a0, %hi(symbol)     # R_RISCV_HI20 (symbol)
    addi a0, a0, %lo(symbol) # R_RISCV_LO12_I (symbol)
----

**GP-Relative Relocations**: If `symbol` is within the range of a signed 12-bit
immediate offset from `__global_pointer$`, then the address can be loaded with a
single instruction which has one relocation, a `R_RISCV_GPREL_I` or
`R_RISCV_GPREL_S`.

The instruction is an I-Type instruction (add immediate or load) with an
`R_RISCV_GPREL_I` or an S-type instruction (store) with an `R_RISCV_GPREL_S`
relocation. The following assembly show loading a gp-relative address:

[,asm]
----
    addi a0, gp, 0          # R_RISCV_GPREL_I (symbol)
----

This relies on the value of `__global_pointer$` being loaded into `gp` (aka
`x3`). This can be used by linker relaxation to delete the `lui` instruction.

==== Global Offset Table

For position independent code in dynamically linked objects, each shared
object contains a GOT (Global Offset Table) which contains addresses of
global symbols (objects and functions) referred to by the dynamically
linked shared object. The GOT in each shared library is filled in by the
dynamic linker during program loading, or on the first call to extern functions.

To avoid runtime relocations within the text segment of position independent
code the GOT is used for indirection. Instead of code loading virtual addresses
directly, as can be done in static code, addresses are loaded from the GOT.
This allows runtime binding to external objects and functions at the expense of
a slightly higher runtime overhead for access to extern objects and functions.

==== Program Linkage Table

The PLT (Program Linkage Table) exists to allow function calls between
dynamically linked shared objects. Each dynamic object has its own
GOT (Global Offset Table) and PLT (Program Linkage Table).

The first entry of a shared object PLT is a special entry that calls
`_dl_runtime_resolve` to resolve the GOT offset for the called function.
The `_dl_runtime_resolve` function in the dynamic loader resolves the
GOT offsets lazily on the first call to any function, except when
`LD_BIND_NOW` is set in which case the GOT entries are populated by the
dynamic linker before the executable is started. Lazy resolution of GOT
entries is intended to speed up program loading by deferring symbol
resolution to the first time the function is called. The first entry
in the PLT occupies two 16 byte entries:

[,asm]
----
1:  auipc  t2, %pcrel_hi(.got.plt)
    sub    t1, t1, t3               # shifted .got.plt offset + hdr size + 12
    l[w|d] t3, %pcrel_lo(1b)(t2)    # _dl_runtime_resolve
    addi   t1, t1, -(hdr size + 12) # shifted .got.plt offset
    addi   t0, t2, %pcrel_lo(1b)    # &.got.plt
    srli   t1, t1, log2(16/PTRSIZE) # .got.plt offset
    l[w|d] t0, PTRSIZE(t0)          # link map
    jr     t3
----

Subsequent function entry stubs in the PLT take up 16 bytes and load a
function pointer from the GOT. On the first call to a function, the
entry redirects to the first PLT entry which calls `_dl_runtime_resolve`
and fills in the GOT entry for subsequent calls to the function:

[,asm]
----
1:  auipc   t3, %pcrel_hi(function@.got.plt)
    l[w|d]  t3, %pcrel_lo(1b)(t3)
    jalr    t1, t3
    nop
----

==== Procedure Calls

`R_RISCV_CALL` and `R_RISCV_CALL_PLT` relocations are associated with
pairs of instructions (`AUIPC+JALR`) generated by the `CALL` or `TAIL`
pseudoinstructions.  Originally, these relocations had slightly different
behavior, but that has turned out to be unnecessary, and they are now
interchangeable.

In position dependent code (`-fno-pic`), with relaxation enabled,
the `AUIPC` instruction in the
`AUIPC+JALR` pair has both a `R_RISCV_CALL` relocation and a `R_RISCV_RELAX`
relocation indicating the instruction sequence can be relaxed during linking.

In position independent code (`-fPIC`, `-fpic` or `-fpie`),
with relaxation enabled, the `AUIPC`
instruction in the `AUIPC+JALR` pair has both a `R_RISCV_CALL_PLT` relocation
and a `R_RISCV_RELAX` relocation indicating the instruction sequence can be
relaxed during linking.

Procedure call linker relaxation allows the `AUIPC+JALR` pair to be relaxed
to the `JAL` instruction when the procedure or PLT entry is within (-1MiB to
+1MiB-2) of the instruction pair.

The pseudoinstruction:

[,asm]
----
    call symbol
----

expands to the following assembly and relocation:

[,asm]
----
    auipc ra, 0           # R_RISCV_CALL (symbol), R_RISCV_RELAX (symbol)
    jalr  ra, ra, 0
----

and when `-fpic` is enabled it expands to:

[,asm]
----
    auipc ra, 0           # R_RISCV_CALL_PLT (symbol), R_RISCV_RELAX (symbol)
    jalr  ra, ra, 0
----

==== PC-Relative Jumps and Branches

Unconditional jump (U+J-Type) instructions have a `R_RISCV_JAL` relocation
that can represent an even signed 21-bit offset (-1MiB to +1MiB-2).

Branch (SB-Type) instructions have a `R_RISCV_BRANCH` relocation that
can represent an even signed 13-bit offset (-4096 to +4094).

==== PC-Relative Symbol Addresses

32-bit PC-relative relocations for symbol addresses on sequences of
instructions such as the `AUIPC+ADDI` instruction pair expanded from
the `la` pseudoinstruction, in position independent code typically
have an associated pair of relocations: `R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` plus
`R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` or `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S`.

The `R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` relocation refers to an `AUIPC` instruction
containing the high 20-bits to be relocated to a symbol relative to the
program counter address of the `AUIPC` instruction. The `AUIPC`
instruction is followed by an I-Type instruction (add immediate or load)
with an `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` relocation or an S-Type instruction (store)
and an `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S` relocation.

The `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` or `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S` relocations contain
a label pointing to an instruction in the same section with an
`R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` relocation entry that points to the target symbol:

* At label: `R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` relocation entry -> symbol
* `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` relocation entry -> label

To get the symbol address to perform the calculation to fill the 12-bit
immediate on the add, load or store instruction the linker finds the
`R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` relocation entry associated with the `AUIPC`
instruction. The addresses for pair of relocations are calculated like this:

[horizontal]
HI20:: `((symbol_address - hi20_reloc_offset + 0x800) >> 12)`
LO12:: `symbol_address - hi20_reloc_offset - (hi20 << 12)`

The successive instruction has a signed 12-bit immediate so the value of the
preceding high 20-bit relocation may have 1 added to it.

Note the compiler emitted instructions for PC-relative symbol addresses are
not necessarily sequential or in pairs. There is a constraint is that the
instruction with the `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` or `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S`
relocation label points to a valid HI20 PC-relative relocation pointing to
the symbol.

Here is example assembler showing the relocation types:

[,asm]
----
label:
    auipc t0, %pcrel_hi(symbol)   # R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20 (symbol)
    lui t1, 1
    lw t2, t0, %pcrel_lo(label)   # R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I (label)
    add t2, t2, t1
    sw t2, t0, %pcrel_lo(label)   # R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S (label)
----

==== Relocation for Alignment

The relocation type `R_RISCV_ALIGN` marks a location that must be aligned to
`N`-bytes, where `N` is the smallest power of two that greater than the value
of the addend field, e.g. `R_RISCV_ALIGN` with addend value 2 means align to 4
bytes; this relocation is only required if the containing section has any
`R_RISCV_RELAX` relocations.

To ensure the linker can always satisfy the required alignment solely by
deleting bytes, the compiler or assembler must emit a `R_RISCV_ALIGN` relocation
and then insert `N - IALIGN` padding bytes before the location where we need to
align, it could be mark by an alignment diretive like `.align`, `.p2align` or
`.balign` or emit by compiler directly, the addend value of that relocation
is the number of padding bytes.

The compiler and assembler must ensure padding bytes are valid instructions
without any side-effect like `nop` or `c.nop`, and make sure those instructions
are aligned to IALIGN if possible.

The linker may remove part of the padding bytes at the linking process to meet
the alignment requirement, and make sure those padding bytes still are valid
instructions and each instruction is aligned to at least IALIGN byte.

NOTE: `R_RISCV_ALIGN` relocation is needed because code relaxation can shrink
preceding code during the linking process, which may cause an aligned location
to become mis-aligned.

NOTE: IALIGN means the instruction-address alignment constraint. IALIGN is 4
bytes in the base ISA, but some ISA extensions, including the compressed ISA
extension, relax IALIGN to 2 bytes. IALIGN may not take on any value other than
4 or 2, this term is also defined in `The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual` in
similar meaning, the only difference is the psABI defined that in byte and
the ISA manual defined that in bits.

=== Thread Local Storage

RISC-V adopts the ELF Thread Local Storage Model in which ELF objects define
`.tbss` and `.tdata` sections and `PT_TLS` program headers that contain the
TLS "initialization images" for new threads. The `.tbss` and `.tdata` sections
are not referenced directly like regular segments, rather they are copied or
allocated to the thread local storage space of newly created threads.
See https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf.

In The ELF Thread Local Storage Model, TLS offsets are used instead of pointers.
The ELF TLS sections are initialization images for the thread local variables of
each new thread. A TLS offset defines an offset into the dynamic thread vector
which is pointed to by the TCB (Thread Control Block). RISC-V uses Variant I as
described by the ELF TLS specification, with `tp` containing the address one
past the end of the TCB.

There are various thread local storage models for statically allocated or
dynamically allocated thread local storage. The following table lists the
thread local storage models:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Mnemonic | Model          | Compiler flags

| TLS LE   | Local Exec     | `-ftls-model=local-exec`
| TLS IE   | Initial Exec   | `-ftls-model=initial-exec`
| TLS LD   | Local Dynamic  | `-ftls-model=local-dynamic`
| TLS GD   | Global Dynamic | `-ftls-model=global-dynamic`
|===

The program linker in the case of static TLS or the dynamic linker in the case
of dynamic TLS allocate TLS offsets for storage of thread local variables.

==== Local Exec

Local exec is a form of static thread local storage. This model is used
when static linking as the TLS offsets are resolved during program linking.

Compiler flag:: `-ftls-model=local-exec`
Variable attribute:: `+__thread int i __attribute__((tls_model("local-exec")));+`

Example assembler load and store of a thread local variable `i` using the
`%tprel_hi`, `%tprel_add` and `%tprel_lo` assembler functions. The emitted
relocations are in comments.

[,asm]
----
    lui  a5,%tprel_hi(i)           # R_RISCV_TPREL_HI20 (symbol)
    add  a5,a5,tp,%tprel_add(i)    # R_RISCV_TPREL_ADD (symbol)
    lw   t0,%tprel_lo(i)(a5)       # R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_I (symbol)
    addi t0,t0,1
    sw   t0,%tprel_lo(i)(a5)       # R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_S (symbol)
----

The `%tprel_add` assembler function does not return a value and is used purely
to associate the `R_RISCV_TPREL_ADD` relocation with the `add` instruction.

==== Initial Exec

Initial exec is is a form of static thread local storage that can be used in
shared libraries that use thread local storage. TLS relocations are performed
at load time. `dlopen` calls to libraries that use thread local storage may fail
when using the initial exec thread local storage model as TLS offsets must all
be resolved at load time. This model uses the GOT to resolve TLS offsets.

Compiler flag:: `-ftls-model=initial-exec`
Variable attribute:: `+__thread int i __attribute__((tls_model("initial-exec")));+`
ELF flags:: DF_STATIC_TLS

Example assembler load and store of a thread local variable `i` using the
`la.tls.ie` pseudoinstruction, with the emitted TLS relocations in comments:

[,asm]
----
    la.tls.ie a5,i
    add  a5,a5,tp
    lw   t0,0(a5)
    addi t0,t0,1
    sw   t0,0(a5)
----

The assembler pseudoinstruction:

[,asm]
----
    la.tls.ie a5,symbol
----

expands to the following assembly instructions and relocations:

[,asm]
----
label:
    auipc a5, 0                   # R_RISCV_TLS_GOT_HI20 (symbol)
    {ld,lw} a5, 0(a5)             # R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I (label)
----

==== Global Dynamic

RISC-V local dynamic and global dynamic TLS models generate equivalent object code.
The Global dynamic thread local storage model is used for PIC Shared libraries and
handles the case where more than one library uses thread local variables, and
additionally allows libraries to be loaded and unloaded at runtime using `dlopen`.
In the global dynamic model, application code calls the dynamic linker function
`__tls_get_addr` to locate TLS offsets into the dynamic thread vector at runtime.

Compiler flag:: `-ftls-model=global-dynamic`
Variable attribute:: `+__thread int i __attribute__((tls_model("global-dynamic")));+`

Example assembler load and store of a thread local variable `i` using the
`la.tls.gd` pseudoinstruction, with the emitted TLS relocations in comments:

[,asm]
----
    la.tls.gd a0,i
    call  __tls_get_addr@plt
    mv   a5,a0
    lw   t0,0(a5)
    addi t0,t0,1
    sw   t0,0(a5)
----

The assembler pseudoinstruction:

[,asm]
----
    la.tls.gd a0,symbol
----

expands to the following assembly instructions and relocations:

[,asm]
----
label:
    auipc a0,0                    # R_RISCV_TLS_GD_HI20 (symbol)
    addi  a0,a0,0                 # R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I (label)
----

In the Global Dynamic model, the runtime library provides the `__tls_get_addr` function:

[,c]
----
extern void *__tls_get_addr (tls_index *ti);
----

where the type tls index are defined as:

[,c]
----
typedef struct
{
  unsigned long int ti_module;
  unsigned long int ti_offset;
} tls_index;
----

==== Detailed attribute description

===== How does this specification describe public attributes?

Each attribute is described in the following structure:
`<Tag name>, <Value>, <Parameter type 1>=<Parameter name 1>[, <Parameter type 2>=<Parameter name 2>]`

===== Tag_RISCV_stack_align, 4, uleb128=value
Tag_RISCV_strict_align records the N-byte stack alignment for this object. The
default value is 16 for RV32I or RV64I, and 4 for RV32E.

It will report erros if link object files with different Tag_RISCV_stack_align values.

===== Tag_RISCV_arch, 5, NTBS=subarch
Tag_RISCV_arch contains a string for the target architecture taken from
the option `-march`. Different architectures will be integrated into a superset
when object files are merged.

Note that the version information for target architecture must be presented
explicitly in the attribute and abbreviations must be expanded. The version
information, if not given by `-march`, must agree with the default
specified by the tool. For example, the architecture `RV32I` has to be recorded
in the attribute as `RV32I2P0` in which `2P0` stands for the default version of
its based ISA. On the other hand, the architecture `RV32G` has to be presented
as `RV32I2P0_M2P0_A2P0_F2P0_D2P0` in which the abbreviation `G` is expanded
to the IMAFD combination with default versions of the standard extensions.

===== Tag_RISCV_unaligned_access, 6, uleb128=value
Tag_RISCV_unaligned_access denotes the code generation policy for this object
file. Its values are defined as follows:

[horizontal]
0:: This object does not perform any unaligned memory accesses.
1:: This object may perform unaligned memory accesses.

===== Tag_RISCV_priv_spec, 8, uleb128=version
===== Tag_RISCV_priv_spec_minor, 10, uleb128=version
===== Tag_RISCV_priv_spec_revision, 12, uleb128=version

Tag_RISCV_priv_spec contains the major/minor/revision version information of
the privileged specification. It will report errors if object files of different
privileged specification versions are merged.

== Code relaxation

At link time, when all the memory objects have been resolved, the code sequence
used to refer to them may be simplified and optimized by the linker by relaxing
some assumptions about the memory layout made at compile time.

Some relocation types, in certain situations, indicate to the linker where this
can happen.  Additionally, some relocation types indicate to the
linker the associated parts of a code sequence that can be thusly simplified,
rather than to instruct the linker how to apply a relocation.

The linker should only perform such relaxations when a R_RISCV_RELAX relocation
is at the same position as a candidate relocation.
